# Summary

## Introduction
Trauma is emerging as a major threat to population health globally. In addition
to prevention, strengthening trauma care is now recognised as imperative to the
global health agenda. Substantial research attributes improved trauma outcomes
in high income countries to quality improvement programmes. Audit filters,
defined as ``pre-identified variables that are routinely tracked to identify
whether accepted standards of care are being met'', for monitoring trauma care
quality are regarded as one of the most essential components of such programmes;
however, there is a paucity of evidence that shows that audit filters are
associated with improved outcomes. Therefore, our primary aim is to assess if
institutional implementation of audit filters reduce mortality in adult trauma
patients. Our secondary aim is to assess if such implementation improve other in
and out of hospital outcomes in adult trauma patients.

## Design
Controlled interrupted time series trial.

## Setting
Four university hospitals in India.

## Participants
Adult patients admitted with history of trauma.

## Primary outcome
All cause mortality within 30 days of arrival to
participating hospital.

## Secondary outcomes
All cause mortality in hospital, within 24 hours
and 90 days, quality of life at 90 days, number of hospital free days to day 30,
number of intensive care unit free days until day 30, and number of items
adhered to in the World Health Organisation's trauma care checklist.

## Covariates
Demographics, vital signs and injury data.

## Statistical methods
Segmented generalized additive model.
