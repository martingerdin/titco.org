# Summary

## Setting

The original TITCO cohort includes data on 16 000 patients admitted to
four public university hospitals in urban India.  At the time of the
research Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India
Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, was a dedicated trauma
centre with almost 180 beds. King Edward Memorial hospital (KEM),
Mumbai, was a tertiary level hospital with no dedicated trauma
ward. Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital (LTMGH), Mumbai was a
tertiary level public university hospital with a dedicated trauma ward
with 14 beds. The Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and
Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital (SSKM), Kolkata
was a tertiary level public university hospital, but without a
dedicated trauma ward. The cost of care in these hospitals was nominal
and the patients admitted represented mainly a lower socioeconomic
stratum of the population. The first patient was enrolled in July 2013
and the last patient in December 2015. The exact enrollment period
varied across participating hospitals.

## Design and participant selection

One dedicated project officer collected data on site for approximately
eight hours, five days per week. The shifts were rotated, so that the
project officers worked morning, evening, and night shifts, and then had
a day off. This way all possible shifts were covered during the course
of a month. Data for patients arriving during the project officers
shifts were collected by direct observation in the area where trauma
patients were received, and the project officers were allowed to ask the
health care staff for values of parameters not entered into the
patient\'s records. For example, if the systolic blood pressure was
measured (the project officer could see it being measured) but was not
documented in the patient record, the project officer was allowed to ask
for its value. Data for patients arriving to hospital outside the
project officers\' shifts were recorded from patient records. These
patients were identified from the nurses\' log books in the emergency
department.

## Eligibility criteria

Patients of all ages were included if they presented with history of
trauma and were admitted or died between arrival and admission. Patients
with isolated limb injury and patients who were dead on arrival were not
included.

## Ethical considerations

We obtained ethical approval for the collection of data for the original
research from each of the participating hospitals. The names of the
ethical bodies and reference numbers were Institute Ethics Committee All
India Institute of Medical Sciences (EC/NP-279/2013 RP-Ol/2013),
Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC(I)/OUT/222/14), Ethics Committee of
the Staff and Research Society (IEC/11/13), and IPGME&R Research
Oversight Committee (IEC/279) for JPNATC, KEM, LTMGH, and SSKM
respectively. We applied for a waiver of informed consent, which was
granted by all review boards. The patients included in this study were
all admitted after trauma, often arriving with an altered level of
consciousness and in severe physical and psychological distress. As the
original research involved only collection of routine data and did not
alter the care provided in any way, we and the ethics committees felt
that obtaining informed consent would be to burden the patients or their
relatives unnecessarily. Names, addresses, telephone, social security or
insurance numbers were never collected.
