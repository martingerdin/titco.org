# Summary

## Introduction
In India a substantial share of trauma deaths happens in urban
areas. Here, prehospital care is largely lacking or poorly
organised. Ambulances are mainly used for transfer of patients between
hospitals. Hence, even the most severe patients arrive to hospital
without being assessed in the prehospital setting and then mix with
the general patient population that presents to the emergency
department. In such scenarios, one of the key challenges in trauma
care is how to prioritise patients so that the patients in greatest
need of care are seen first, i.e. triage. Our aim is to validate and
compare published prediction models for use in early trauma care.

## Design
Prospective multicentre cohort

## Setting
Three hospitals in urban India

## Participants
Any person aged > 18 years presenting to the emergency department (ED)
of participating sites with history of trauma.

## Primary outcome
Mortality within 30 days of arrival to hospital. Extracted by project
officer from patient record as date and time of death or discharge. If
the patient is discharged alive before 30 days of arrival the research
officer will call the patient or patient relative 30 days after
arrival to hospital to establish the patient’s status.

## Secondary outcomes

- Mortality within 24 hours of presentation to hospital. Extracted by
  project officer from patient record as date and time of death or
  discharge. If the patient is discharged alive before 24 hours of
  arrival the research officer will call the patient or patient
  relatives 24 hours after arrival to hospital to establish the
  patient’s status.
- Mortality within six months of presentation to hospital. Extracted
  by project officer from patient record as date and time of death or
  discharge. If the patient is discharged alive before six months of
  arrival the research officer will call the patient or patient
  relatives six months after arrival to hospital to establish the
  patient’s status.
- Mortality in participating hospital. Extracted by project officer
  from patient record as date and time of death or discharge.
- Admission to ward/hospital admission. Extracted by project officer
  from patient record and/or ascertained during follow up calls with
  patient or relative.
- Admission to intensive care unit. Extracted by project officer from
  patient record and/or ascertained during follow up calls with
  patient or relative.

## Covariates
Demographics, vital signs and injury data.

## Statistical methods
We will compare models using measures of discrimination, calibration, and net benefit.
